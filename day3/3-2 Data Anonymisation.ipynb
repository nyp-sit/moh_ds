    "# Data Anonymisation\n",
    "Personal data is the core concept of data protection. Data protection law only applies when data relates to individuals. Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) provides a baseline standard of protection for personal data in Singapore. The PDPA recognises both the need to protect individuals’ personal data and the need of organisations to collect, use or disclose personal data for legitimate and reasonable purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organisations are required to comply with the various data protection obligations if they undertake activities relating to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in the field of Big Data, Data Science or related fields it is essential to know about these laws and how anonymization and pseudonymization give the possibility of still using the data for your use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Personal Data?\n",
    "This is any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. An “identifiable” person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by means of association with an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data or other special characteristics. The possibility of identifying a person is sufficient here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal data are, for example:\n",
    "* Name\n",
    "* Address\n",
    "* E-mail address\n",
    "* Telephone number\n",
    "* Birthday\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonymising data offers one solution. When data is anonymised, it is no longer personal data. In this practical, we will cover various techniques to anonymise data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anonympy\n",
    "**anonympy** is a genearal data anonymisation library for images, PDFs, and tabular data. You will need to install the following two packages:\n",
    "> pip install anonympy\n",
    "\n",
    "> pip install cape-privacy==0.3.0 --no-deps\n",
    "\n",
    "If you faced issues with anonympy package, you can download the repository from <a href='https://pypi.org/project/anonympy/#files'>pypi</a>, unzip the repository and run the following command in ananconda prompt:\n",
    "> python setup.py install\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by importing the data for this practical.\n",
